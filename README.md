PROJECT NAME: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION USING PYTHON
- This model predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.
- The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket, class, fare, cabin, and whether or 
  not they survived. 
- This is a Data Science Project.

# CODSOFT-TASK2
PROJECT NAME: MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON
- Building a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors.
- I have used regression techniques to tackle this problem.
- The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.
- The movie Rating Prediction project lets us explore data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques.
- It provides insights into the factors that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.

# CODSOFT-TASK3
PROJECT NAME: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION USING PYTHON AND MACHINE LEARNING
- The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
- These species can be distinguished based on their measurements.
- Now, imagine that you have the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species.
- I aim to train a machine learning model to learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.
- Using the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.
- This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.
